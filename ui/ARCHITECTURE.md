# Frontend Architecture Decisions

This document explains the key architectural and design decisions made for the Employee Directory frontend application.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### **JWT with Refresh Tokens**

- **Why**: Stateless authentication with automatic token renewal
- **Token Storage Strategy**:
    - Refresh tokens stored in http-only cookies (protected from JavaScript access)
    - Access tokens stored in Zustand store (persisted to localStorage)
    - Access token persistence is acceptable due to short lifespan (15 minutes)
- **Benefits**:
    - No server-side session storage
    - Automatic token refresh
    - Secure token rotation
    - XSS protection for refresh tokens

## ü™ù Custom Hooks

### **useLocalize**

- **Why**: Centralized localization logic with type safety
- **Benefits**:
    - Type-safe translation keys
    - Consistent localization across components
    - Easy to maintain and update translations
- **Implementation**: Custom hook that wraps react-i18next with additional type checking

### **useDebounce**

- **Why**: Optimize performance for search operation
- **Benefits**:
    - Reduce API calls during user input
    - Improve search performance
    - Better user experience
- **Implementation**: Custom hook that delays function execution until user stops typing

## üé® UI/UX Decisions

### **Responsive Design**

- **Why**: Mobile-first approach for better accessibility
- **Implementation**: Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- **Key Feature**: **Fully responsive application** that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
